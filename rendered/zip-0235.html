<h1 id="terminology">Terminology</h1>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “MAY”, “RECOMMENDED”,
“OPTIONAL”, and “REQUIRED” in this document are to be interpreted as
described in RFC 2119. [1]</p>
<p>The term “network upgrade” in this document is to be interpreted as
described in ZIP 200. [2]</p>
<p>“Block Subsidy” - the algorithmic issuance of ZEC on block creation.
Part of the consensus rules. Split between the miner and the Dev Fund.
Also known as Block Reward.</p>
<p>“Issuance” - The method by which ZEC becomes available for
circulation on the network.</p>
<p>“We” - the ZIP authors, owners listed in the above front matter</p>
<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>We propose to divert 60% of transaction fees into the Sustainability
Fund (ZSF) proposed by ZIP-233, while the remaining 40% be directed as
before. This proposal effectively “unmints” a portion of transaction
fees, providing a deflationary effect, and building the groundwork for
long-term support of the Zcash network.</p>
<p>This ZIP does not introduce any method of accessing the fees
deposited into the ZSF, but ZIP-234 proposes to introduce such a
mechanism via block subsidy.</p>
<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>While ZIP-233 (“Establish the Zcash Sustainability Fund”) describes a
method by which funds can be deposited directly into the Sustainability
Fund, such deposits are entirely optional.</p>
<p>By introducing a requirement that a certain proportion of transaction
fees be deposited into the ZSF, we ensure the ZSF will accrue value and
begin contributing to future network sustainability.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-to-the-network">Benefits to the Network</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Network Sustainability</strong>: This mechanism involves
temporarily reducing the supply of ZEC, similar to asset burning in
Ethereum’s EIP-1559, but with potential long-term sustainability
benefits, as the redistribution of deposits contributes to issuance
rewards and network development, making it an attractive option for
current and future Zcash users.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem Benefits of Longer Time Horizons</strong>: A
reliable and long-term functioning Zcash blockchain allows users to make
secure long-term plans, leading to a sustainable and virtuous adoption
cycle, rather than being influenced by short-term trends.</li>
<li><strong>Incentivizing Transaction Inclusion</strong>: By maintaining
a 40% share of transaction fees for miners, we incentivize miners to
prioritize including transactions in their blocks. This helps ensure the
continued efficient processing of transactions and supports a robust and
responsive network.</li>
<li><strong>Future-Proofing the Network</strong>: Diverting transaction
fees into the ZSF is a forward-looking approach that prepares the Zcash
network for future challenges and opportunities. It establishes a
financial buffer that can be instrumental in addressing unforeseen
issues and seizing strategic advantages as the Zcash ecosystem
evolves.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>For each block, at least 60% (rounded down) of the total fees are to
be paid to the ZSF.</li>
<li>No restrictions are placed on the destination of the remaining
proportion of fees.</li>
<li>Any fractions are rounded in favour of the miner.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="specification">Specification</h1>
<h2 id="consensus-rule-changes">Consensus Rule Changes</h2>
<p>For a given block, the coinbase transaction MUST have a
<code>zsf_deposit</code> that is greater than or equal to
<code>floor(transaction_fees * 6 / 10)</code>.</p>
<p>In transaction versions without the <code>zsf_deposit</code> field,
the total output value of the coinbase transaction MUST be the value of
the block subsidy, plus
<code>ceil(transaction_fees * 4 / 10)</code>.</p>
<h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1>
<p>The implementation of this ZIP MUST be deployed at the same time or
after the Zcash Sustainability Fund (ZIP-233), and subsidy smoothing
(ZIP-234).</p>
<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>
<p>We believe the proposed changes to be relatively low-impact in terms
of implementation and protocol changes. Additionally, transaction fees
are currently small enough that the reduction in miner fees is unlikely
to be a concern.</p>
<h2 id="estimated-impact-on-miners">Estimated impact on miners</h2>
<p>Over 100,000 blocks starting at block 2235515, there were 316130
transactions. 60608 of them are categorized as ‘sandblasting’
transactions. The remaining transactions have an average of 5.46 logical
actions (see ZIP-317 [4]).</p>
<p>The total fees paid to miners from those transactions, assuming the
ZIP-317 regime, would be 87.86 ZEC. 100,000 blocks is approximately 3
months of blocks. Extrapolating to a year, we would expect 351.44 ZEC in
fees paid to miners over a year.</p>
<p>If 60% of these fees were diverted to the ZSF, that would be 210.864
ZEC per year. [5]</p>
<h2 id="considerations-for-the-future">Considerations for the
Future</h2>
<p>If transaction fees were to increase, further modifications can
easily be proposed to alter the 60%/40% split. Finding the optimal fee
split may require an iterative approach involving adjustments based on
real-world data and network dynamics.</p>
<p>Looking further into the future, there may come a time when the
transaction fees become greater than the block subsidy issuance. At that
time we may need to reconsider the 60/40 split. However, this will
likely not be the case for the next 8-10 years due to forecasts based on
issuance models and network traffic.</p>
<p>Further ZIPs may be proposed to fund the ZSF in various ways,
including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ZSA fees</li>
<li>Fees and donations specific to decentralized applications</li>
<li>“Storage fees” for any future data availability</li>
<li>Cross-chain bridge usage / Cross-chain messaging</li>
<li>Note sorting micro-transactional fees</li>
</ul>
