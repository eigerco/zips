# Terminology

The key words “MUST”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “MAY”, “RECOMMENDED”, “OPTIONAL”,
and “REQUIRED” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
[1]

The term “network upgrade” in this document is to be interpreted as described in
ZIP 200. [2]

"Block Subsidy” - the algorithmic issuance of ZEC on block creation. Part of the
consensus rules. Split between the miner and the Dev Fund. Also known as Block
Reward.

"Issuance" - The method by which ZEC becomes available for circulation on the
network.

“We” - the ZIP authors, owners listed in the above front matter

# Abstract

We propose to divert 60% of transaction fees into the Sustainability Fund
(ZSF) proposed by ZIP-233, while the remaining 40% be directed as before. This
proposal effectively “unmints” a portion of transaction fees, providing a
deflationary effect, and building the groundwork for long-term support of the
Zcash network.

This ZIP does not introduce any method of accessing the fees deposited into the
ZSF, but ZIP-234 proposes to introduce such a mechanism via block subsidy.

# Motivation

While ZIP-233 ("Establish the Zcash Sustainability Fund") describes a method
by which funds can be deposited directly into the Sustainability Fund, such
deposits are entirely optional.

By introducing a requirement that a certain proportion of transaction fees
be deposited into the ZSF, we ensure the ZSF will accrue value and begin
contributing to future network sustainability.

## Benefits to the Network

1. **Network Sustainability**: This mechanism involves temporarily reducing
   the supply of ZEC, similar to asset burning in Ethereum’s EIP-1559, but
   with potential long-term sustainability benefits, as the redistribution of
   deposits contributes to issuance rewards and network development, making it
   an attractive option for current and future Zcash users.
2. **Ecosystem Benefits of Longer Time Horizons**: A reliable and long-term
   functioning Zcash blockchain allows users to make secure long-term plans,
   leading to a sustainable and virtuous adoption cycle, rather than being
   influenced by short-term trends.
3. **Incentivizing Transaction Inclusion**: By maintaining a 40% share of
   transaction fees for miners, we incentivize miners to prioritize including
   transactions in their blocks. This helps ensure the continued efficient
   processing of transactions and supports a robust and responsive network.
4. **Future-Proofing the Network**: Diverting transaction fees into the ZSF is a
   forward-looking approach that prepares the Zcash network for future challenges
   and opportunities. It establishes a financial buffer that can be instrumental
   in addressing unforeseen issues and seizing strategic advantages as the Zcash
   ecosystem evolves.

# Requirements

* For each block, at least 60% (rounded down) of the total fees are to be paid
to the ZSF.
* No restrictions are placed on the destination of the remaining proportion of
fees.
* Any fractions are rounded in favour of the miner.

# Specification

## Consensus Rule Changes

For a given block, the coinbase transaction MUST have a `zsf_deposit` that is
greater than or equal to `floor(transaction_fees * 6 / 10)`.

In transaction versions without the `zsf_deposit` field, the total output value
of the coinbase transaction MUST be the value of the block subsidy, plus
`ceil(transaction_fees * 4 / 10)`.

# Deployment

The implementation of this ZIP MUST be deployed at the same time or after the
Zcash Sustainability Fund (ZIP-233), and subsidy smoothing (ZIP-234).

# Rationale

We believe the proposed changes to be relatively low-impact in terms of
implementation and protocol changes. Additionally, transaction fees are
currently small enough that the reduction in miner fees is unlikely to be a
concern.

## Estimated impact on miners

Over 100,000 blocks starting at block 2235515, there were 316130 transactions.
60608 of them are categorized as 'sandblasting' transactions. The remaining
transactions have an average of 5.46 logical actions (see ZIP-317 [4]).

The total fees paid to miners from those transactions, assuming the ZIP-317
regime, would be 87.86 ZEC. 100,000 blocks is approximately 3 months of blocks.
Extrapolating to a year, we would expect 351.44 ZEC in fees paid to miners over
a year.

If 60% of these fees were diverted to the ZSF, that would be 210.864 ZEC per
year. [5]

## Considerations for the Future

If transaction fees were to increase, further modifications can easily be
proposed to alter the 60%/40% split. Finding the optimal fee split may require
an iterative approach involving adjustments based on real-world data and network
dynamics.

Looking further into the future, there may come a time when the transaction fees
become greater than the block subsidy issuance. At that time we may need to
reconsider the 60/40 split. However, this will likely not be the case for the
next 8-10 years due to forecasts based on issuance models and network traffic.

Further ZIPs may be proposed to fund the ZSF in various ways, including but not
limited to:

- ZSA fees
- Fees and donations specific to decentralized applications
- “Storage fees” for any future data availability
- Cross-chain bridge usage / Cross-chain messaging
- Note sorting micro-transactional fees
